  abstract={Abstract:
This paper aims to briefly summarize and outline the modern state of USVs (Unmanned Surface Vehicles) and UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) technologies performing tasks in a cooperative way, and a proposed solution of a solar USV concept design, to satisfy the primary goal for creating a long-lasting mobile autonomous launch-and-recovery system for UAV, autonomous batteries charging and missions planning. This includes as well, a related problematic, and reasons that motivate the research, a comparison between recent existing systems and conceptual design. The results of a proposed solution and conceptual design are summarized with reference to the project's goals, while future works involved within the project are also discussed.},

    abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},

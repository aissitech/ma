I’m **Mohammed Aissi**, a passionate engineer working at the intersection of **robotics**, **autonomous systems**, and **embedded software**. With a background in **drone engineering** and current experience in the **automotive industry**, I focus on developing and testing smart, autonomous solutions — from **UAVs** and **UGVs** to **automotive ECUs**.

I'm actively involved in research around **AI-powered navigation**, **simulation environments** (ROS, Gazebo, ArduPilot), and **hardware-software integration**. My goal is to contribute to the future of intelligent systems through innovation and continuous learning.
